# Schema migrations and database backups

Applies to `investment_screener/backend/data/domain_model.sqlite` (the sole source of truth for
holdings, accounts, targets and thesis data). `intelligence.sqlite` still uses its own
`py_services/intelligence/migrations/`; it shares only the backup tooling for now.

## Why this exists

Before this change the schema was defined in **seven places**: `db_client.py` plus six
TypeScript repositories, each with its own `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. Four TypeScript
repositories declared their own, narrower `investment` table. Because `IF NOT EXISTS` never
compares columns, whichever code ran first on an empty file decided the shape for good. The
databases are gitignored and run in WAL mode, so there was also no recoverable copy of the data.

## The rules

1. **Python is the only code that creates or alters tables.** `schema_migrator.py` applies the
   numbered files in `investment_screener/backend/schema/domain_model/`.
2. **Node never touches DDL.** Each TypeScript repository calls `ensureSchemaReady()`
   (`src/utils/schemaVersion.ts`), which checks `PRAGMA user_version`:

   | Database state | What happens |
   |---|---|
   | Version matches the newest migration file | proceed |
   | New or empty file | the Python migrator is asked to build it (nothing to lose) |
   | Populated file that is **behind** | refused, with the command to run |
   | File **ahead** of this checkout | refused: update the code first |
3. **Applied migrations are immutable.** Each is recorded in `schema_migrations` with a SHA-256
   checksum; editing one later fails startup. Fix forward with a new file.
4. **A populated database is backed up before any pending migration**, and the migration runs in
   one transaction, so a failure rolls back completely.

## Adding a schema change

1. Add the next file: `investment_screener/backend/schema/domain_model/0002_<snake_case>.sql`.
   Plain SQL, no `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` (the runner wraps it). Numbers must be contiguous.
2. Run `python3 investment_screener/backend/py_services/domain_model/schema_migrator.py --status`
   to see it pending, then the same command without `--status` to apply it.
3. Add or update tests. Do **not** touch `0001_baseline.sql` or any applied migration.
4. If a migration rebuilds a table, it must run with foreign keys off, which SQLite cannot
   change inside a transaction. Handle that case in the runner before writing such a migration.

`run_investment_toolkit.py` runs the migrator on every launch, after the backend build and before
the servers start.

## Databases that existed before the migrator

A file with tables but no `schema_migrations` ledger is *adopted*: missing tables are created,
the three retired late columns are added, and the result is compared with `0001_baseline.sql`
(columns, types, defaults, foreign keys, indexes). If they match it is stamped as version 1. If
not, adoption is **refused and the file is left exactly as found**, with the differences listed.
This was dry-run against a copy of the live database: all 20 tables kept identical row counts.

## Backups

`py_services/domain_model/db_backup.py` uses SQLite's online backup API. Copying only the
`.sqlite` file silently loses data still sitting in the `-wal` file; this does not.

| When | Label | Kept |
|---|---|---|
| Every launch of `run_investment_toolkit.py` | none | newest 14 per database |
| Before a pending migration on a populated file | `pre-migration-NNNN` | counted in the same 14 |
| Before a restore | `pre-restore` | counted in the same 14 |

Files go to `investment_screener/backend/data/backups/` (gitignored), one self-contained
`.sqlite` each, and every backup passes `PRAGMA integrity_check` before it is kept.

```bash
python3 investment_screener/backend/py_services/domain_model/db_backup.py backup  --db domain_model
python3 investment_screener/backend/py_services/domain_model/db_backup.py list    --db domain_model
python3 investment_screener/backend/py_services/domain_model/db_backup.py verify  <backup-file>
# Restore: STOP the backend first. A safety copy of the current file is taken automatically.
python3 investment_screener/backend/py_services/domain_model/db_backup.py restore <backup-file> --db domain_model --yes
```

Backups live on the same disk as the database, so they protect against bad writes and bad
migrations, not against losing the machine. Copy `backups/` somewhere else for that.

## Known gaps (not addressed here)

* `intelligence.sqlite` migrations are separate and not yet unified with this runner.
* The reference file `plugins/toolkit-manager/references/data-architecture/sql/03_domain_data_model_schema.sql`
  is a historical design document, superseded by the migration files.
* Broker sync does not yet trigger its own backup; the launch-time backup is the safety net.
