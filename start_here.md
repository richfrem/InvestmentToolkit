## 🔥 ACTIVE: Fable5 Elevation Guide — Phase 1 DONE, start Phase 2 here

**Context:** User had Fable5 (primary), Gemini, GPT, Grok review the codebase for
"next level" improvements — reviews saved at `temp/bundles/full-bundle/reviews/`.
Fable5's guide (`fable5-ELEVATION_GUIDE.md`) is the one being executed — the only review
grounded in the actual repo. It's a 6-phase roadmap: (1) data layer, (2) valuation
committee, (3) executable scoring framework + local TA engine, (4) TradingView/Pine
hardening, (5) risk engine + rebalancer + prediction ledger + backtesting, (6) skills/
sub-agent architecture cleanup. **This session starts fresh on Phase 2 — Phase 1 is fully
shipped, verified, and merged to `origin/main`. Nothing from Phase 1 needs redoing.**

### ✅ Phase 1 (data layer) — COMPLETE, on `origin/main` right now
`py_services/market_data.py` (+ `cache.py`, `edgar_facts.py`, `data_quality.py`, schema) —
a unified, cached, quality-gated provider abstraction (yfinance + SEC EDGAR) built to
eliminate a real bug class found this session (missing/NaN external data silently becoming
a wrong number, e.g. the dashboard's impossible "+29.79% today" bug). Built as 8 TDD-gated
tasks via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`, each implementer→review→fix→re-review
cycle documented in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-02-market-data-layer.md` and the
now-closed ledger. Whole-branch review passed twice (once before, once after a 3-finding
fix round). **Confirmed merged into `origin/main` via PR #59** (`git log origin/main` shows
`73d7c19` as HEAD) — verified directly, not assumed.

**Deliberately deferred, NOT part of Phase 1, pick up whenever convenient (not blockers):**
1. **13-file yfinance migration** onto the new `market_data.py` — `fetch_financials.py`,
   `portfolio_performance.py`, `macro_regime.py`, `earnings_calendar.py`, `fetch_quotes.py`,
   `overnight_gaps.py`, `fetch_portfolio_heatmap.py`, `history_store.py`, ETF/TV scripts,
   one TS-adjacent file. Each needs reading fresh for accurate before/after steps.
   `fetch_financials.py` has its own bespoke 1hr-TTL cache at
   `plugins/stock-valuation/scripts/cache/` that must be *replaced*, not duplicated.
2. **Cache-key collision**: `get_fundamentals()` and `get_estimates()` share cache key
   `(ticker, "fundamentals")` — confirmed safe (no misread) but whichever runs second
   overwrites the other's entry. Fix before any caller uses both for the same ticker.

### 🚦 Git policy going forward
Phase 1 shipped to `origin/main` via the user merging the PR themselves on GitHub. **This
is the standing pattern**: after each phase's whole-branch review passes, Claude pushes a
dedicated `feature/fable5-phase<N>-<name>` branch to `origin` as a backup/PR source —
**Claude never merges or opens the PR into `origin/main`.** The user reviews and merges via
GitHub's PR flow themselves, on their own timing. So the full sequence per phase: brainstorm
→ spec → plan → `subagent-driven-development` in a fresh worktree → whole-branch review →
merge to local `main` → push `feature/fable5-phase<N>-<name>` to origin → **stop there** —
report the branch is ready, do not merge/PR/touch `origin/main`.

**Git hygiene lesson from tonight, worth repeating:** after pushing a backup branch, keep
committing/pushing as work continues — don't let further edits (e.g. to this file) sit
uncommitted after a branch is already pushed, or the backup silently goes stale. Verify any
"is it pushed" claim with `git fetch` + `git log <ref>` before asserting it's done, not
from memory of having run `git push` earlier.

### Next step for this session
Pick a Phase 2 sub-project from `fable5-ELEVATION_GUIDE.md` §2 (Valuation Committee:
reverse-DCF, WACC, Monte Carlo/sensitivity, comps cross-check) or reorder if something else
is more urgent — confirm with the user first (this repo's brainstorming skill gate applies:
don't start implementation before a design is proposed and approved). §9 in the guide has
the full phase/acceptance-criteria breakdown if useful context.

## 🟡 Other open items from 2026-07-02 (not yet resolved, unrelated to Fable5)

1. **BE position** — user said they'd exit manually ("I'll do it myself, standby") after
   overriding the `ALLOWLISTED_CONFLICT` standing decision. TV showed the position still
   fully held (2 TFSA + 1 RRSP) as of the last check — confirm current status before
   assuming it's closed.
2. **CRWV/PANW target-weight update** — proposed (CRWV 5.23%→6.07%, PANW 4.45%→3.65%) to
   lock in the user's manual trades as new standing targets. Never confirmed/written.
3. **TV balance fetch (`fetch_broker_data.py --snapshot`)** — still doesn't fetch account
   balances in the same call as positions (needs a separate `--balances` call). One repair
   attempt (mousedown/mouseup/click dispatch fix to `clickTab()` in `broker_data.js`,
   uncommitted) did not fully resolve it — `totals.totalUSD` still falls back to
   `computed_fallback` until this is fixed properly.

## ⚡ Start Every Day With One Command

```
/daily
```

The `daily-loop-agent` handles everything interactively — no checklist to follow manually:
1. Checks portfolio.json freshness → auto-syncs from TradingView if stale
2. Runs the morning brief: macro regime (VIX + SPY 200D + HYG/LQD), TA sweep, conviction scores, earnings calendar
3. Ranks holdings by urgency: IMMINENT events → EXIT signals → REDUCE → ACCUMULATE
4. Walks through each as a card — proposes a trade, waits for your yes/no
5. Offers `/x-news-sweep` on news/catalyst days
6. Logs the session to `plugins/portfolio-advisor/references/evolution-log.md`

**After 7+ daily runs**, the agent surfaces multi-day patterns: consecutive EXIT signals, deteriorating pillars, repeated score drops. It auto-recommends `/strategic-review` when pillar stress is detected — the loop compounds.

**Cadence:**
| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Every session | `/daily` |
| Weekend review (markets closed) | `/weekly-review` |
| After 13F filing or major catalyst | `/run-advisor` |
| Evaluating a new stock or thesis change | `thesis-review-agent` |

## 🔴 Pending Decisions / Open Items

### 1. Dashboard: Show Entry Prices in Recommendations Table ← **PRIORITY TASK**
The modal currently shows `ACCUMULATE`, `INITIATE`, `TRIM` etc. but **not the target entry price**.
`targetEntryPrice` is now a first-class field in `target-portfolio.json` (added 2026-06-04).

**What needs building:**
- `generate_review_json.py` → include `targetEntryPrice` in the per-holding JSON output
- `InvestmentThesisModal.tsx` (or equivalent frontend component) → display "ACCUMULATE @ $X" instead of just "ACCUMULATE"
- The table column should show: `Action | Entry Price` — e.g. "ACCUMULATE @ $210" for NBIS
- If `targetEntryPrice` is null → show "—" or "at market"

**Only SNDK has a price set so far ($1,350).**
After the dashboard is wired up, run a pass to set entry prices for all ACCUMULATE positions.
Use formula as a starting point: `min(dcf_fair_value * 0.85, current_price * 0.85)` — then adjust per TA.

### 2. GTC Automation for Limit Orders ← **TV CDP BUG**
`/place-order` places limit orders as **Day** duration by default.
TradingView's "Extra Settings → Time in force" dropdown opens correctly via CDP but the
"Good till cancelled" option text isn't found (the dropdown uses fixed-position elements
that escape standard visibility checks).

**Where to fix:** `tradingview-cdp/core/trading.js` → `setGoodTillCancelled()`
The `clickDayAndSnapshot()` diagnostic shows the dropdown opens; the GTC option text
needs a position:fixed-aware selector or coordinate-based click.

**Workaround until fixed:** After placing a GTC limit, manually change duration in
TradingView broker panel → Orders tab.

### 3. Active GTC Limit Order
- **CBRS @ $185 TFSA** — lock-up dip target (Nov 2026). User manually set to GTC on 2026-06-01.
  Do not cancel unless user instructs.

### 4. PSU-U.TO Target Reconciliation
- **Actual: 16.2%** vs **Target: 11.9%** → TRIM signal of ~4.3pp
- User has NOT instructed a trim — PSU is their HISA/cash reserve, they're comfortable overweight
- Do not prompt to trim PSU unless user raises it

## 🛠️ Recent System Changes (June 2026)

### New Capabilities
- **`/weekly-review` Command**: Extends sweep functionality to the weekend, conducting a range-based drift analysis and compiling a news sweep prompt.
- **Dynamic ETF/Cash Exclusions**: Grok prompt generators automatically scan `etf_analysis/*.json` and filter them out from standard stock sweeps along with cash.
- **Grok Prompt Templates**: Centralized in `plugins/portfolio-advisor/assets/templates/` (`daily_sweep.md.template` and `weekly_sweep.md.template`) for programmatic generation.
- **Thesis-Template Auto-Sync**: Enforced via self-evolution policy and `thesis-review-agent` execution step. Templates auto-update when strategic pillars shift.
- **Strict Compliance instructions**: Anti-laziness rules prevent Grok from outputting lazy placeholders and enforce single-ticker entries for all listed stocks.
- **`targetEntryPrice` field** — GTC limit price per holding in `target-portfolio.json`
- **Fractional shares** — `place_order.py --shares 0.2` now works
- **Portfolio sync fallback** — after fills: Express API → direct CDP snapshot → Questrade REST
- **`fetch_broker_data.py --snapshot`** — now fetches balances BEFORE positions, writes live `cashUSD` + `totalUSD` to portfolio.json
- **Auto-proceed in `/x-news-sweep`** — no longer waits for "apply" when all items APPROVED/WARN-allowlisted. Only gates on CONFIRM/BLOCKED.

## 🚀 Next Session

**Start with `/daily` — it handles the rest.**

Open items to pick up:
1. **Priority build**: Wire `targetEntryPrice` into review JSON + dashboard modal (see item #1 above)
2. **Set entry prices** for all ACCUMULATE positions once dashboard shows them
3. **GTC automation fix** in `trading.js` → `setGoodTillCancelled()` (see item #2 above)
4. **SNDK**: Do not add unless price drops to $1,350 or below
5. **CEG/OKLO**: Hold, only trim when back in profit ($364 / $101 respectively)

---

## 💡 Key Principles (user preferences)

- Recommendations must include **target entry price** — "ACCUMULATE" without a price is incomplete
- **Valuation always matters** — factor in current price vs DCF, not just directional signal
  (e.g. SNDK DCF says BUY +49% but that was calculated at $1,333; real upside at $1,741 is only 14%)
- **PSU-U.TO is HISA/cash equivalent** — not a trade, not a trim candidate unless user says so
- **CEG/OKLO**: only sell when green — both are underwater, hold discipline
- **Account structure**: TFSA is primary (larger), RRSP mirrors at ~1/3 share count
- **GTC limit orders**: after placing via CLI, manually change duration in TradingView broker panel
- **PSU cash source**: PSU-U.TO can be sold to fund new buys if cash is depleted
